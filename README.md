## Overview

This repository serves as both an issue tracker and as a reference for anyone using Reforged's Public API service. This repository is **not** for other Reforged related items.

## Issues and Bugs

Do not discuss / share any vulnerabilities or bugs that can be used to exploit the API or our platforms. Instead, please private message iamlexivale on discord or Lexivale on the minecraft.

## Contributing

The Reforged Team has decided to make the Official Public API Documentation a community effort, as well as put a foot forward towards developing an ecosystem that is built off of our API service. We hope in the future language specific libraries and wrappers are built around our API service, and more creative tools created by the community are to come!

Best of luck, and happy coding!
